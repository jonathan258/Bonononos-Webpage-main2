  <h1>About Chef Puet</h1>
  <p>My name is Pueuetanist Robinson, but I also go by the name Puet. I am the chef and co-owner, working alongside my wife, Shacharouna. I am responsible for ordering, receiving, and overseeing the preparation and service of all the food. With over 20 years of experience in the food industry, I spent 10 years in Jamaica—my place of birth—and another 10 here in Canada. Cooking has always been in my blood, as I worked alongside my grandmother who owned a restaurant in Jamaica.</p>
  <p>Upon arriving in Canada 12 years ago with my wife, I spent 9 years at the PEI Preserve Company, with 3 years as the main cook and an additional year as the kitchen supervisor. Currently, I work as a line cook at Papa Joe's restaurant. In my free time, I play and watch a lot of soccer with my son and enjoy traveling with my family.</p>
  <p>One of my greatest achievements is completing my studies at Holland College, where I pursued Hospitality Management at the Culinary Institute of Canada. My current goal is to introduce Jamaican cuisine to Prince Edward Island and eventually expand its presence throughout Canada.</p>
